# Module 1: Challenge 1: Refactor Horiseon Code

This week's challenge asked us to take pre-existing code from a client/user and update it/refactor it in order to be complient with the standards of web accessibility.

User Story:
* AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done:
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

* It is done:
WHEN I rework the CSS for efficiency through consolidation of selectors and properties as well as an organization following the semantic structure of the HTML elements.

* It is done:
WHEN comments have been added in the HTML and CSS to explain changes and major sections of each file.
